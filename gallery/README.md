# Semantic Computer Vision

What is semantic computer vision? This fascinating field is the intersection of computer graphics / computer vision / computational geometry - to study man-made graphics, instead of photographs. Artificial graphics should not be treated as natural signals - the information we try to convey via graphics is intentional and so requires deliberate treatment.

For the technologies that we developed, they all share a common set of techniques and some of them were published in the `visioncortex` programming library. The principles are simple - recognition is information reduction as we move up to higher level of abstract representations. So the first step is always statistical - we perform statistical image segmentation and statistical shape analysis.
