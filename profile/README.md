To posterity:

I spent a lot of time in thinking about 'symbol' and what it means.
Is it a fundamental concept that can exist outside of human experience, or is it an artifact that only makes sense to the human brain, specifically, the visual cortex?
From the [ShapeCode](https://github.com/visioncortex/ShapeCode) investigation, although unpublished, I think I have got an answer that satisfied me.

In case you wonder, [VTracer](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer) is really a by-product of a side-quest which happens to be really useful.

The next thing I am interested in, which is equally fascinating, is 'scribble', aka hand writing recognition.
If you are interested in building the next open-source hand writing recognition engine from scratch together, may be we can have a chat.
