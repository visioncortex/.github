To posterity:

I spent a lot of time in thinking about 'symbol' and what it means.
Is it a fundamental concept that can exist outside of human experience, or is it an artifact that only makes sense to the human brain, specifically, the structure of the visual cortex?
From the [ShapeCode](https://github.com/visioncortex/ShapeCode) investigation, although unpublished, I think I have got an answer that satisfied me.

The next thing I am interested in, which is equally fascinating, is 'scribble', aka hand writing recognition.
If you are interested in building the next open-source hand writing recognition engine from scratch together, may be we can have a chat.
